        "comment": "In a phase 3 trial, 572 patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 receptor negative advanced breast cancer who previously received endocrine therapy were allocated to alpelisib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status (N=341). PIK3CA mutation was determined according to the presence or absence of any hot spot mutation in the C2, helical, and kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exon 7, 9, and 20, respectively). In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.65, p<0.001). In the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the HR was 0.85. Analyses of PFS according to mutation types showed consistent benefit of treatment with alpelisib\u2013fulvestrant across prespecified subgroups, including E542K (N=60, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.29-1.23), E545X, and H1047X.",

Of 179 V600E patients in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 68% of patients had a response, which was 15 percentage points higher than in the dabrafenib-alone group (95% CI, 4 to 24; P=0.006).",
