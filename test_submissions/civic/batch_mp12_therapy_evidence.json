At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. A relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression was observed with vemurafenib as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons).",
