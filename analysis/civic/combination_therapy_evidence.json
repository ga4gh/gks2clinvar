        "comment": "The open-label phase 3 BEACON CRC trial included 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic CRC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators\u2019 choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI. The median overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to 11.0) in the doublet-therapy group and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.6) in the control group, with a significantly lower risk of death compared to the control group (hazard ratio for death doublet-group vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group, 20% in the doublet-therapy group (95% CI 13 to 29) and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (doublet group vs. control P<0.001). Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) in the doublet-therapy group, and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression doublet-group vs control, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52, P<0.001).",
