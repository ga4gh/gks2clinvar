This specific variant Q61K has been documented as a hotspot in minimally 10 samples, and variation occurring within the same amino acid position has been identified in minimally 50 samples in the cancerhotspots.org database (ClinGen/CGC/VICC 2022: OS3). Functional studies support an oncogenic effect for this variant (ClinGen/CGC/VICC 2022: OS2). This variant has not been identified in control populations (or at an extremely low minor allele frequency) within gnomAD, a large-scale population database (ClinGen/CGC/VICC 2022: OP4). In silico algorithms suggest that this variant has an oncogenic effect on the gene product (ClinGen/CGC/VICC 2022: OP1)."
